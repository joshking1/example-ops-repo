# This code seems to be part of an Ansible playbook or role that is creating or deleting a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) in AWS (Amazon Web Services).
# The first task is named "create a vpc" and imports a task called "create.yml". It only runs if the value of the "vpc_state" variable is set to "present". 
# This suggests that the "create.yml" task contains the actual steps to create the VPC.
# The second task is named "absent a vpc" and imports a task called "absent.yml". It only runs if the value of the "vpc_state" variable is set to "absent". 
# This suggests that the "absent.yml" task contains the actual steps to delete the VPC.
# So depending on the value of the "vpc_state" variable, the playbook or role will either create or delete the VPC using the appropriate task.
