# what each line means:

# vpc_ingress:: This is the start of the configuration block for inbound traffic rules.

# - [98, 'icmp', 'allow', '0.0.0.0/0', 0 , 0]: This line is setting up a rule that allows ICMP traffic of type 0 and code 0. ICMP type 0 is used for ping replies, so this rule will allow incoming ping replies from any IP address.

# - [99, 'icmp', 'allow', '0.0.0.0/0', 8 , 0]: This line is setting up a rule that allows ICMP traffic of type 8 and code 0. ICMP type 8 is used for ping requests, so this rule will allow incoming ping requests from any IP address.

# In both cases, the 'allow' parameter indicates that the traffic should be allowed. The '0.0.0.0/0' parameter in the third position means that the rule applies to any IP address. The first position (98 and 99) is just an identifier for the rule, and the second position ('icmp') indicates that the rule applies to ICMP traffic.

# Explaining the code above 

# Here's what each line means:

# {% for key, value in mgmt_public_ips.items()|sort %}: This line is starting a loop that will iterate over a dictionary called mgmt_public_ips and sort it. The loop will assign each key-value pair to key and value, respectively.

# - [{{ loop.index + 120 }}, 'tcp', 'allow', '{{ value.ip }}', null, null, 0, 65535 ] # {{ value.comment }}: This line is setting up a rule for allowing TCP traffic from the IP address specified in the value.ip field. The loop.index + 120 part is just an identifier for the rule, which is generated based on the loop index. The rule allows traffic on all TCP ports from 0 to 65535. The {{ value.comment }} part is just a comment that will be included in the configuration file to help identify the rule.

# {% endfor %}: This line is the end of the loop.

# - [400, 'tcp', 'allow', '0.0.0.0/0', null, null, 32768, 65535 ]: This line is setting up a rule for allowing TCP traffic from any IP address. The rule allows traffic on ports 32768 to 65535.

# - [401, 'udp', 'allow', '0.0.0.0/0', null, null, 32768, 65535 ]: This line is setting up a rule for allowing UDP traffic from any IP address. The rule allows traffic on ports 32768 to 65535.
